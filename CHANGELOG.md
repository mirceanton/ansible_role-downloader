# Changelog

## v2.0.0

**:bomb: Breaking Changes**:

* Removed all default prerequisites which were (un)archiving tools. You now need to install them manually if needed.
* Made the archive expansion optional. This should also include the case in which the release is a single executable file, not archived.
* Renamed some of the variables. :sweat_smile:

## v1.0.0

* Initial release of the `mirceanton.downloader` role 🚀
